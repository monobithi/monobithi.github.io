            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello voyager,</p>
            <p>Welcome aboard on the ship — your very own Monobithi !!! You must’ve had a hard journey out there in the cold, harsh world, but don’t you worry ! You’ve hit the right place ! Time flows differently here, my friend. No hurries, no worries, just take your time and explore the new world that you’ve entered. It’s a long way and we hope you have a wonderful experience as you let your mind flow, for Monobithi is nothing but ‘The Meanderings of Imagination’ !!!</p>
            <p>You must be wondering now, what is Monobithi all about ? Hold on, we’ll give you the answer.</p>
            <p>Monobithi is the place where imagination  runs wild. It is the place where you can be who you are — not the one others know you to be, but the actual ‘you’ — the child in you, who wants a break from the  world  around, who wants to do the things that you love to do, who wants to have some real, some really real fun. </p>
            <p>Still Confused?</p>
            <p>Okay, let’s be more precise. Monobithi is an illustrated bilingual e-magazine,published twice a year , with a Spring and an Autumn  issue . This magazine is for children, not ‘children’ by age, but the child that remains within all of us, like a tiny flicker of light. Here,we  gather together to summon our creativity to the tip of our brush and the nib of our pen (and to all those other things which right now escapes my mind) and do whatever we feel like doing. We  are lovers of art. Heard of the phrase ‘Art for art’s sake’? Well, that’s the motto we passionately believe in. And since you’re here, you must do so too ! That’s not all,though. Monobithi is our way of paying a small tribute to the man who taught us to live for art — Satyajit Ray, our teacher, guide and friend, whose ‘Sandesh’ is the biggest inspiration behind our magazine.</p>
            <p>But hey ! We’ve been talking for quite a long time now. You should really start exploring now, for there’s a lot to explore ! Bon Voyage !!</p>
